Hello, welcome! 👋

<details><summary>About me</summary>
My name is Johnny, I am a software engineer focused on learning C# and GDScript, but I'm open to learning new technologies!
  
I am enthusiastic about problem solving and working in teams to achieve my goals.
  
I like to create and build things and learn more about whatever I'm working with!
  
Outside of programming and software development, I like to meet up with friends, play and write music and write short stories.
