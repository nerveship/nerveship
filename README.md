My name is Johnny, I am a software engineer focused on learning C# and GDScript, but I'm open to learning new technologies!
  
I am enthusiastic about problem solving and working in teams to achieve my goals.
  
I like to create and build things and learn more about whatever I'm working with!
  
Outside of programming and software development, I like to meet up with friends, play and write music and write short stories.

  <details><summary>Untitled Room Game</summary>
    An ambitious 3d title where a character lives their entire life in their room, checking their computer to read emails, browse the net and discover rumours surrounding their city and space online. Worked on in collaboration with artists and writers and hosted on Github, but in a private repo at the moment. When the game is released, I will link to it here!
